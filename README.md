This file contains procedures for testing the energy consumption and inference time of different ML export formats. It is mainly divided into text classification and image classification tasks.

ML models for text classification： LSTM/XGboost/Random forest
ML models classification: CNN/xgboost/Random forest

（All test tasks were based on the macOS platform and used PowerMetrics to record CPU and GUP energy consumption information. Therefore, you need to grant the appropriate programme privileges in the terminal before testing.）
